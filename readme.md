This code need more work. The web code is plainly a copy of treebankstudio.org page, besides that three references has been added to it, two to CodeMirror files that would have to be accessible on the web, along with the file in this repo, holding the hint file itself, that defines the autocompletion hints when a user is using the web.

It is possible to try out the function of the hint file by pasting the code from the file to the .js window here: https://codepen.io/_kkeisuke/pen/BJGpqG  .

The python code is meant to be referenced to after the user submits the query by pressing enter. The code reviews the input and points out if there are any improvements opportunities. The user should then be able to fire the request to the treebankstudio.
